**World Context:** 

The world is a unique blend of medieval fantasy and Western influences. In the wake of a devastating dragon attack on a part of the colony, the ranks of inquisitors—those responsible for maintaining law and order—have been severely diminished. This power vacuum has led to an uptick in lawlessness, with bandits and traffickers exploiting the weakened system.

**Main quest:**

The protagonist, a seasoned bounty hunter, successfully takes down a group of human traffickers. Among the rescued captives is a young half-orc child (Lira) who appears to have no family. Fearing she might fall victim to slavery or exploitation again, the bounty hunter resolves to accompany her deeper into the continent. Their goal is twofold: uncover her origins and reunite her with her family—if they can be found—or unravel the truth behind her abandonment. 

**Start of side quest:**

Lira seems to catch a scent, her nose twitching as she points in a specific direction. The protagonist can use their **{Enhanced Senses}** to pick up the faint sound of hissing snakes and the distant cry of a child.

If the protagonist chooses to follow the sound or head toward where Lira is pointing, they will discover a child surrounded by three giant snakes**\[SawKid \= true\]**. If not  **\[SaveKid \= false\]**.

The protagonist must decide whether to intervene. If they choose to fight and successfully defeat the snakes without the child being harmed, they can approach the child and attempt to speak with them. **\[SaveKid \= true\].** If they choose to do nothing  **\[SaveKid \= false\]**.

The kid is bleeding—that was what Lira smelled. Upon closer inspection, the protagonist sees the child clutching their arm, tears streaming down their face. A brief conversation reveals that the child had tried to get a rare herb to craft medicine for their older sister but was bitten by one of the snakes during the attempt.

The protagonist recognizes the bite is venomous and realizes the child needs urgent care. They can choose one of the following actions:

* **Use {Antidote}:** Administer an antidote to neutralize the venom.  
* **Cast {Cure Poison}:** Use magic to cleanse the venom from the child’s body.  
* **Use a Similar Item:** Apply an item with the same effect to save the child.

If the protagonist acts quickly, the child survives. **\[SaveKid \= true\]**  
If the protagonist chooses to do nothing, the venom takes its toll, and the child succumbs to the bite. **\[SaveKid \= false\]**

 

The protagonist arrives in the Village. there were just around 20 houses but there is older houses destroyed, probably during the dragon attack, this part of the continent more people were affected by the attack

If **\[SaveKid \= true\] {**

The protagonist enters the village with Lira and the boy, Ben. Despite her inability to speak, Lira seems to have formed an unspoken bond with the boy. Through simple gestures and expressions, they appear to understand each other

"Ben\! Your mom’s been out of her mind looking for you\!" The boy visibly shrinks back, clearly bracing for a scolding.

The man then turns to the protagonist, his tone sharp but curious. "Where did you find him? He didn’t get into any trouble, did he?"

The player can now choose how to respond:

* **Tell the truth:** Explain that Ben had wandered far from the village, was surrounded by snakes while searching for herbs to help his sister, and was bitten in the process. **\[SaysTruthAboutFindingsBen\]\[VillagersKarma \+2\]**  
* **Lie:** Claim that Ben was found close to the village and just wanted a ride on the horse. **\[SaysLieAboutFindingsBen\]**

**}** 

If **\[SaysTruthAboutFindingsBen\]{**

 The older man listens to your explanation, his expression softening with a mix of sadness and weariness.

"Sorry to trouble you," he says, his apologetic tone. "As you can see, things aren’t going very well for us here. We don’t have money to pay you back for your time, but Ben’s mom makes the best potato cakes for miles around. Come on, follow me."

He gestures for you to follow, guiding you and Lira toward the village’s small inn.

**}**  
If **\[SaysLieAboutFindingsBen\]{**

The older man narrows his eyes slightly. He seems suspicious but ultimately decides the hassle isn’t worth pursuing further.

"Alright then. Anyway, Ben, get yourself to your mom—she’s been worried sick."

Ben slides off the horse and looks back at you and Lira with a grin. "Come on\! My mom makes the best potato cakes you’ll ever taste\!"

Lira glances up at you, her large eyes silently asking for permission. After a moment’s consideration, you decide to spend the night in the village. Following the boy’s lead, you make your way to the inn.

**}**

If **\[SaveKid \= false\]{**

The protagonist arrives at the village with Lira, who seems more withdrawn than usual. Her typical quiet demeanor is now tinged with visible sadness, her gaze fixed on the ground. The villagers offer no warm welcomes as you approach—no one steps forward to greet you.

The tension in the air is palpable. The protagonist keeps their vigilant eyes on the villagers, and in return, the villagers watch him with wary, cautious gazes. The scars of hardship are evident in their faces, a reflection of the struggles this place has endured.

As the protagonist stops near the small, weathered inn at the center of the village, they are presented with a choice:

* **Enter the Inn**:The protagonist dismounts, leading Lira inside.  
* **Do Not Enter**:The protagonist decides not to linger. Turning away from the inn and the village, they leave, ending this chapter of their journey. **\[End of Quest\]**

**}**

If **\[SaveKid \= true\] && \[SaysTruthAboutFindingsBen\]{**

The older man leads you into the inn, where a woman behind the counter notices Ben and rushes over.

"Ben\!" she exclaims. After hearing the story from Gust, she scolds Ben, giving him a playful punch to the ear. Ben flinches and hides behind Lira, who looks uneasy.

The woman notices Lira's discomfort and softens, then introduces herself as Maggie, with Gust beside her.

She gestures to a nearby table and asks, "What can I get you to drink?"

The protagonist can choose:

* **"Something strong."**  
* **"Water, please."**

**}**

If **\[SaveKid \= true\] && \[SaysLieAboutFindingsBen\]{**

Ben enters the inn with Lira, and a woman behind the counter notices him immediately.

"Ben\!" she exclaims, rushing over. Ben repeats the lie the protagonist told Gust, and the woman watches you carefully, suspicion in her eyes. After a moment, she softens and gestures toward a nearby table.

"Alright, then," she says, "Sit down. What can I get you to drink?"

The protagonist can choose:

* **"Something strong."**  
* **"Water, please."**

**}**

If **\[SaveKid \= false\] {**

The protagonist enters the inn with Lira. The woman behind the counter quickly spins around, her face showing clear signs of distress and sadness. After a brief moment, you take a seat. It takes a little time, but eventually, the woman approaches, her eyes darting nervously around the room.

"Do you want something to drink or eat?" she asks quietly, her tone filled with concern.

The protagonist can choose:

* **“Something to eat”**  
* **"Something strong and something to eat"**  
* **“Water and something to eat, please."**  
* **"Something strong."**  
* **"Water, please."**

**}**

If **\[SaveKid \= true\] {**

While eating Maggie’s potato cake, a man enters the inn. His clothes are nicer than the others, and the badge on his chest identifies him as the sheriff of the town. He smiles as he looks at you.

"So, you're the ones who helped Maggie's kid?" he says, sitting beside you. "Let me introduce myself—I'm Silv, the sheriff around here." he says, waiting for you to introduce yourself.

The player can choose:

* **Introduce yourself.**  
* **Keep quiet.**  **\[SilvKarm \-1\]**

Maggie approaches, looking visibly apprehensive with Silv. "Hi, Sheriff. Would you like something?" she asks

Silv waves her off. "Come on, Maggie, just call me Silv." He glances at your plate, his expression turning slightly sour. "So, you had some of her potato cake, huh?" His eyes narrow, unhappy with the situation. **\[SilvKarm \-1\]**

He then asks, "So, how long do you plan on staying?"

The protagonist can choose:

* **"Need some rest to continue my trip."**  
  Silv stands up, nodding. "Oh, of course. You helped my beautiful Maggie, so rest your horse and get ready to head out." He leaves, waving goodbye to Lira, Ben, and Maggie.  
* **"That’s not your concern."**  
  Silv raises an eyebrow, his smirk fading. "Oww, looks like we’ve got someone who likes trouble." He sits back down, leaning in with a more serious tone. "Take care, cowboy. A lot of people are dying in this part of the continent. No one knows what could happen." After a moment, he stands up and leaves the inn, still eyeing you warily as he goes **\[SilvKarm \-4\]**

If **\[SaveKid \= false\] {**

The door to the inn opens, and a man enters, his clothes much finer than the others in the village. The badge on his chest marks him as the sheriff of the town. A young child stands beside him.

The woman behind the counter immediately notices them and rushes over.

"Ben\!" she exclaims, her voice a mix of relief and worry. "Ah, thank you, Sheriff. I was so worried about him."

The sheriff steps forward, his tone calm but firm. "No need to worry, I’m here to help. Though, of course, this boy had to go and pick a fight with snakes. Had to use one of my personal antidotes to save him. Those aren’t cheap, you know."

The woman’s concern grows. "I’ll pay as soon as I can."

Then, he seems to notice you—an outsider—and his attention shifts. He gently breaks away from Maggie and approaches your table. His posture is more formal now, his gaze studying you with keen interest.

“Hi, I'm Silv, the sheriff around here." he says, waiting for you to introduce yourself.

The player can choose:

* **Introduce yourself.**  
* **Keep quiet.**  **\[SilvKarm \-1\]**

He then asks, "So, how long do you plan on staying?"

The protagonist can choose:

* **"Need some rest to continue my trip."**  
  Silv stands up, nodding. "Oh, of course, so rest your horse and get ready to head out." He leaves, waving goodbye to Ben, and Maggie.  
* **"That’s not your concern."**  
  Silv raises an eyebrow, his smirk fading. "Oww, looks like we’ve got someone who likes trouble." He sits back down, leaning in with a more serious tone. "Take care, cowboy. A lot of people are dying in this part of the continent. No one knows what could happen." After a moment, he stands up and leaves the inn, still eyeing you warily as he goes **\[SilvKarm \-4\]**

**}**

The next morning, after a night of rest, the protagonist interacts briefly with Ben, who seems to have warmed up to Lira. Maggie approaches later and explains that the village is struggling. Though she avoids mentioning the sheriff, it’s clear the situation is dire.

She offers the protagonist a place to stay at the inn if they’re willing to help with the village’s needs. There is no money to be earned, but their assistance could make a difference. Player can choose

* **Hints from Maggie:** If you ask Maggie about the herb, she mentions that *Stonebloom* emits a faint but distinctive scent similar to citrus when crushed.

* **Success:** You return with the *Stonebloom*, saving Ben’s sister. Maggie is grateful, and the villagers trust you more, but the sheriff dislikes your interference **\[SilvKarm \-2\]\[VillagersKarma \+2\]\[SaveBenSister \= true\]**

As you explore, Lira rushes toward a wall adorned with draconic inscriptions. To your surprise, she seems to be reading the language, which is unexpected for a half-orc of her age. Upon closer inspection, you find a hidden vault embedded within the wall. Inside, there’s an old, ornate dagger. Lira looks at it longingly and asks if she can have it, but you’re not required to give it to her.

If **\[SilvKarm \<= \-7 \] {**

As you continue your work in the village, the sheriff, Silv, approaches you. His mood is clearly foul, and his voice is harsh. “So what’s your deal? Trying to be a hero or just annoying me?” He steps closer, his tone sour. “I know you think of yourself as some fierce bounty hunter, but there’s a reason no bandits have come here so far—it’s because I’m here and I’m powerful. You have your own problems.” Silv points to Lira, his gaze hardening. “Don’t make your life worse. This village would be ten times worse without me. I just want a reward for my hard work.” He gives you a cold stare. “I’m not here to fight. Let’s just say this is a friendly tip.”

Player Choices:

* **Back Down and Leave: \[End of Quest\]**

If **\[SilvKarm \<= \-12 \] {**

Lira senses the tension, her unease growing as Silv approaches. She runs to Maggie at your request, leaving you alone to face the sheriff. Silv, his hand on his gun, speaks coldly: "I had hoped we could have solved this differently, but you had to keep trying to be a hero, trying to steal my village from me." The battle begins with Silv drawing his weapon.

Upon winning the villages celebrate being free from their sherif tyranny and thank you

**\[SilvDead \== false\] && \[VillagersKarma \> 5\]  {**

As you arrive in the village, Ben runs up excitedly to greet you and Lira. After a cheerful exchange, you notice a hint of sadness in his voice and decide to follow him to the inn.

**If \[SaveBenSister=true\]{**Inside, you spot Ben’s older sister working behind the counter, looking healthy and well**}**

 Maggie, their mother, approaches to welcome you with a warm smile. As you exchange pleasantries, your eyes catch a wedding band on her finger. Curiosity gets the better of you, and you ask about it.

Her expression shifts to sadness, and she hesitates before explaining that she married Silv—she had to. Her gaze briefly shifts to her daughter before she changes the subject. To lighten the mood, Maggie sends over a fresh slice of her famous potato cake and the same drink you ordered last time, a small gesture of gratitude.

**If \[StormWolfPupies=true\]{**

After your conversation with Maggie, the door to the inn swings open, and Silv strides in. His sharp gaze sweeps the room before locking onto you. With a smirk, he approaches and slides into the seat across from you.

“Hey, cowboy, long time no see,” he says, his tone dripping with feigned familiarity. Leaning back, he continues, “You know, last time you were here, you left quite the mess. Those Stormwolves? They were a real nuisance to the village.” His face contorts into an exaggerated mockery of sadness. “I had no choice but to take care of them.”

He stands up abruptly but pauses before leaving. His eyes narrow as he adds, “Hope you don’t stir up any more trouble this time.”

As he walks away, he stops by Maggie, planting a kiss on her cheek. She flinches ever so slightly, but he doesn’t seem to notice—or care. Turning back to you, Silv flashes a sly grin, his expression loaded with meaning, before stepping out of the inn.  
**}**

**\[SilvDead \== true\] && \[TrainedStormWolfPupies=true\] {**

As you approach the village, signs of a recent struggle catch your eye—broken fences, scorched patches of earth, and scattered debris hint at a fight. Before you can dwell on it, Ben appears, riding atop a young Stormwolf. Though not yet fully grown, the creature is already an impressive size, its fur bristling with energy.

“Hi, \[Player.name\]\! Long time no see\!” Ben grins widely, guiding his mount closer atop the young Stormwolf. “Come on, my mom and sister will love to see you\!”

**If \[SaveBenSister=true\]{**At the inn, you find Ben’s older sister at work, cleaning tables and carrying trays with a smile.**}**

 Maggie soon greets you warmly, relief and joy in her eyes. As you catch up, she explains the aftermath of your last visit.

“After Silv was gone, the village had a hard time. A group of bandits came through, thinking they could take whatever they wanted.” She pauses, pride creeping into her voice. “But they didn’t expect the Stormwolves. They’d grown enough to fight back, and together, we drove those bandits away.”

The atmosphere is lighter now, the villagers clearly grateful for the newfound strength their wolves have brought. Maggie insists you stay for dinner, and you have the option to offer some meat to celebrate your return. The villagers eagerly prepare a small feast, a testament to their resilience—and their gratitude for your help.

**}**

**\[SilvDead \== true\] && \[TrainedStormWolfPupies=true\] {**  
You arrive at the site where the village once stood, only to be met with a haunting scene. Corpses lie scattered, and the remnants of homes are charred and crumbled. The devastation speaks for itself—after your departure, bandits must have struck, their attack unopposed with no sheriff to defend the villagers. Everyone is gone.
